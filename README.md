# Future Vote Platform

## Overview
The Future Vote Platform facilitates secure and transparent voting using Ethereum blockchain technology. Users can cast their votes securely from anywhere, ensuring inclusivity and integrity in the electoral process.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Eligibility Determination:** No VoterID required as users' eligibility (age: 18+) is dynamically determined using a custom DID system.
- **Secure Voting with Ethereum:** Votes are securely recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and integrity.
- **Cost-Effective:** Reduced costs during the election process through Ethereum's efficient transaction model and Ganache's local testing environment.
- **Decentralized Accessibility:** Shorter wait times and accessibility from anywhere in the country due to decentralization.
- **Nationwide Participation:** Voters can cast their votes from anywhere within the country using the web-based interface.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Highly scalable design capable of handling increased demand during peak periods.
- **Continuous Engagement:** Efficient election system allows the portal to remain operational for extended periods, increasing voter turnout.

## Technologies Used
- **Ethereum Blockchain:** Provides the underlying infrastructure for recording and validating votes, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Ganache:** Local blockchain for testing and development, offering a fast and customizable environment.
- **Truffle:** Development framework for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Custom DID System:** Provides decentralized identity authentication for users participating in the voting process, enhancing security and privacy.
- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Used for decentralized storage of candidate information, ensuring accessibility and redundancy.
- **MongoDB:** Document-oriented database for storing non-blockchain data, such as user information and voting statistics.
- **Web Interface:** Allows users to access the voting system via a user-friendly interface, facilitating the casting of votes.
- **Solidity:** Smart contract development language for Ethereum blockchain.
- **Python:** Programming language used for backend development, integration with Ethereum blockchain, and communication with the frontend.
